**VoltQuest** is an open source game that teaches electronics through interactive, hands on circuits.
Drag components, build circuits, solve real problems and learn by experimenting.

## 🎮 What VoltQuest Is About

VoltQuest is all about exploring electronics through play.
Instead of reading theory, you get to **build, test, and tweak circuits yourself** and by seeing how components behave in real time.

It’s designed to be approachable whether you’re just starting out or already comfortable with electronics.
The game gradually introduces new parts and challenges, letting you grow your skills at your own pace.

👉 **The goal** is to make electronics less intimidating and more fun, by turning learning into an interactive experience.
No boring lectures, just hands on experimenting.
